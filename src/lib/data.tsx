          When buying or selling property in Telangana, one of the most important legal documents

          ownership from the seller to the buyer and is legally registered at the
          Sub-Registrar’s Office (SRO).
        </p>

          To prove ownership or apply for property-related services, you often need a Certified

          As the world moves towards digitization, the concept of property ownership is also
          evolving. Digital property ownership utilizes modern technologies like blockchain to
          create immutable, transparent, and secure records of property titles and transactions.

        <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl font-bold">Why is Electricity Bill Name Change Important?</h2>
        <p>The electricity bill is not just a utility slip. It is a legal ownership and address proof document. Here is why changing the name matters:</p>
        <ul className="list-disc space-y-2 pl-6">
          <li><strong>Proof of Ownership:</strong> Ensures the new owner’s name reflects in utility records.</li>
          <li><strong>Legal Compliance:</strong> Required for property resale, bank loans, and official KYC updates.</li>
          <li><strong>Billing Accuracy:</strong> Prevents disputes about unpaid bills or arrears under the old owner’s name.</li>
          <li><strong>Inheritance and Transfers:</strong> Smooth transfer of utility rights when property passes through family succession.</li>
          <li><strong>Government Services:</strong> Acts as proof in property tax filings, Aadhaar updates, and government benefits.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Failure to update the bill can lead to legal issues, billing disputes, or even disconnection of supply.</p>

        <p>
          Investing in property in India is a significant financial commitment. Before taking the
          plunge, conducting a thorough property audit is not just recommended—it's essential. A
          property audit is a detailed examination of property records to ensure the title is
          clear, marketable, and free from any legal disputes.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl font-bold">Why is a Property Audit Crucial?</h2>

          A detailed audit report provides a clear picture of the property's legal standing. It
          helps in identifying potential risks such as ownership disputes, liens, mortgages, or
          other encumbrances. Neglecting this step can lead to disastrous financial losses and
