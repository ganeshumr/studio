        <p>
          Investing in property in India is a significant financial commitment. Before taking the
          plunge, conducting a thorough property audit is not just recommended—it's essential. A
          property audit is a detailed examination of property records to ensure the title is
          clear, marketable, and free from any legal disputes.
        </p>
        <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl font-bold">Why is a Property Audit Crucial?</h2>
        <p>
          A detailed audit report provides a clear picture of the property's legal standing. It
          helps in identifying potential risks such as ownership disputes, liens, mortgages, or
          other encumbrances. Neglecting this step can lead to disastrous financial losses and
          legal battles.
