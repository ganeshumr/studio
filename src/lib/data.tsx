        <p>
          When buying or selling property in Telangana, one of the most important legal documents
          is the Sale Deed (also known as the Deed of Sale). It records the transfer of property
          ownership from the seller to the buyer and is legally registered at the
          Sub-Registrar‚Äôs Office (SRO).
        </p>
        
        <p>
          To prove ownership or apply for property-related services, you often need a Certified
          Copy (CC) of the Sale Deed. With digital access, it‚Äôs now easier than ever to

        <p>
          As the world moves towards digitization, the concept of property ownership is also
          evolving. Digital property ownership utilizes modern technologies like blockchain to
          create immutable, transparent, and secure records of property titles and transactions.

        <h2 className="font-headline text-2xl font-bold">
          What is Digital Ownership and Why Does It Matter?
        </h2>
        <p>
          Digital ownership refers to storing property records on a decentralized, cryptographic
          ledger. Unlike traditional paper-based systems that are prone to fraud, tampering, and
          loss, a digital system offers unprecedented security.
